# The Ruby Games Project  

The aim of the Ruby Games Project is to take a Ruby project through different stages of evolution.  Below are the four main stages:  

## *Stage 1: Command line*

Play games from the command line!  
Current games are: Mad Libs, Rock Paper Scissors, I Spy, Hangman, Tic Tac Toe, Blackjack

**Play now!**

Clone to local repository with:
```
git clone https://github.com/tobylad/ruby_games_stage_1.git
```
Change into games directory:
```
cd ruby_games_stage_1
```
Run with:
```ruby
ruby runner.rb
```

Enjoy!  Feedback is *always* appreciated so please don't hesitate (and before you give it read about the whole project :) )



## *Stage 2: Web Application*
*!!Currently on this stage!!*

Full-Stack Web Application.  Play the same games you could in the command line version, but in a much prettier and user-friendly version in your browser!  

Built with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.

## Inspiration

In June of last year, I would have called myself computer-savvy, but I'd have thought FizzBuzz was a drink.

After deciding to make a major life change, I fully immersed myself into the world of web development.  This first anniversary project is a way to chronicle that journey and show off the skills I've rapidly gained throughout the last year.
