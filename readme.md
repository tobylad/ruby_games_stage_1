# The Ruby Games Project  

The aim of the Ruby Games Project is to take a Ruby project through different stages of evolution.  Below are the four main stages:  

## *Stage 1: Command line/method only*

This stage contains games built entirely from Ruby methods.  It's the Wild West out here.

**Play now!**

Clone to local repository with:
```
git clone https://github.com/tobylad/ruby_games_stage_1.git
```
Change into games directory:
```
cd ruby_games_stage_1
```
Run with:
```ruby
ruby runner.rb
```

Enjoy!  Feedback is *always* appreciated so please don't hesitate (and before you give it read about the whole project :) )



## *Stage 2: Class Structure/Test Coverage*
*!!Currently on this stage!!*

This stage refactors stage 1, moving all game logic into classes, and fully backing them with RSpec tests.  So not much will change on your end as compared to Stage 1, but the backend foundation will be much stronger.

## *Stage 3: Full-Stack Web Application*

The games brought to life on a web page with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, persisted with a SQL database, and deployed LIVE for the entire world to play!

Try to beat the high score!
(Ahh, nostalgia...)

## Inspiration

Before June of last year, I would have called myself computer-savvy, but I had no idea how to write a lick of code.

After deciding to make a major life change, I fully immersed myself in programming and the world of web development.  This first anniversary project is a way to chronicle that journey - in code.
