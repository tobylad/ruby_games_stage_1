# The Ruby Games Project  

The aim of the Ruby Games Project is to take a Ruby project through different stages of evolution.  Below are the four main stages:  

## *Stage 1: Command line/method only*

This stage contains games built entirely from Ruby methods.  It's the Wild West out here.

**Play now!**

Clone to local repository with:
```
git clone https://github.com/tobylad/ruby_games_stage_1.git
```

Change into directory, then run:
```ruby
ruby runner.rb
```

Enjoy!  Feedback is *always* appreciated so please don't hesitate (and before you give it read about the whole project :) )



## *Stage 2: Class Structure/Test Coverage*

This stage refactors stage 1, moving all game logic into classes, and fully backing them with RSpec tests.  Is she pretty to look at?  Not yet, but she's worth bringing home to the folks!

## *Stage 3: Fun with TTY*

With all logic in place, stage 2 is refactored into a project not only fun to play on the command line, but more visually appealing as well!  The total package!

## *Stage 4: Full-Stack Web Application*

The games brought to life on a web page with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript, persisted with a SQL database, and deployed LIVE for the entire world to play!

Try to beat the high score!
(Ahh, nostalgia...)

## Inspiration

In June of 2017, I barely knew what HTML was.  After deciding to make a major change, I fully immersed myself in programming and the world of web development.  This first anniversary project is a way to chronicle that journey - in code.
